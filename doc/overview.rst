Overview
========

JGRPG consists of several parts. The *rule system* describes the rules of the RPG.
You don't need any other components to play --- just pen and paper will
suffice. The *toolkit* is a piece of software designed to let you create
things in the system and support you while you play the game. The *website* is
a resource for sharing things you create with others.

JGRPG Rule System
=================

The JGRPG Rule System has these fundamental goals:

* It is *open*. It should support many different styles of RPG.

* It is *pedantic*. If this were a pen-and-paper RPG, this would make this
  system impossible to play. But it's intended to be run with the help of a
  computer, so it should be quite possible to play. The rules are pedantic
  because they are not left up to the imagination of the players. Every detail
  is explained.

* It is built to *help* tell stories. That is, it will not replace the
  story-telling, but supplement it.

* It will encourage people to *add* things to the universe, or remove the bits
  they don't like.

JGRPG Toolkit
=============

The JGRPG Toolkit (this software) is an app written to execute the rules of
the JGRPG Rule System. It is free software licensed under the GPL. Please read
the license to understand your rights and responsibilities under this license.

You are encouraged to look at the source code and modify it. It is there for
you. I tried to write it in a way that people can extend it easily with their
own code.

=============
JGRPG Website
=============

The JGRPG Website is a place where people can share their work with each
other.
